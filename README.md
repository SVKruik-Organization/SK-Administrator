# SK Administrator

Welcome to SK Administrator, a sleek & modern administrator application to manage the SK Platform project. From viewing status & logs to managing finance, SK Administrator does it all. This is the 'staff' version of [SK Commander](https://github.com/SVKruik-Organization/SK-Commander).

Because a simple `README.md` can only do so much, I have also made an documentation platform, [SK Docs](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation). If you are serious about using my products, I highly recommend reading the relevant articles. Don't have time for that? Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://skpvt.io/r/support). I am always open to have a chat and answer questions to your heart's content, unless I am debugging deployment ðŸ˜„.
